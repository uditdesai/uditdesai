Design-oriented developer specializing in user experience and web development. I'm currently studying computer engineering at the University of Toronto and completing an internship at Sanctuary Computer, a development studio in NYC. On the side, I also work on select freelance technology projects with friends :)

In the past, I've worked at small to large non-profits and companies. Last year, I interned at Shopify and help built the subscriptions experience and functionality for online stores.

I'm interested in fashion, health and fitness, design, reading, and recently making juice.
