### Hey 👋

My name's Udit (he/him), I'm a developer and designer from Toronto. I'm currently working at Shopify as a UX developer 💻 and studying computer engineering at The University of Toronto 🎒

On the side, I like collaborating on building creative experiences for the web. Somethings I've built before are [hxouse.com](https://www.hxouse.com/), [andrasii.com](https://www.andrasii.com/), and I'm currently in the process of building e-commerce stores for local brands in Toronto ✨ I'm always open to working on a new project — feel free to reach out!

### Get in Touch ☕️
